<!-- What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop? -->

While Loop:

The condition is checked before the loop executes.
If the condition is false at the beginning, the loop might not execute at all.

while (condition) {
    // code to execute
}


Do-While Loop:

The condition is checked after the loop executes, ensuring that the loop will run at least once.
Even if the condition is false, the loop body will be executed at least once.

do {
    // code to execute
} while (condition);
