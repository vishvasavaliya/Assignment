 <!-- Explain how to access and update object properties using dot notation and bracket notation -->

 dot notation

Use the dot (.) operator followed by the property name.
Dot notation is cleaner and more readable but requires the property name to be a valid JavaScript identifier 

object.property

bracket notation

Use square brackets ([]) with the property name as a string.
Bracket notation is more versatile and allows access to properties with names that are not valid identifiers
 
object['property']
