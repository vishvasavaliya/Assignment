<!-- How is JavaScript different from other programming languages like Python orJava? -->

JavaScript:- 
              - JavaScript is the language of the web, designed to manipulate web pages and create interactive user experiences.

              - JavaScript responds to events, such as button clicks or page loads, triggering specific functions.

              - Variables don't need to be declared with a specific data type.

              - Curly braces and semicolons are used to define blocks and statements.




 Python:- 
            - Python is a versatile and user-friendly programming language.

            - Python code is executed line by line, eliminating the need for compilation, which speeds up the development process.

            - Python supports object-oriented programming language.

            - You don't need to explicitly declare variable types, making code more flexible and concise.
            
            - Python code can run on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

            -  Frameworks like Django and Flask enable rapid development of web applications.

   
 java:-  
            - Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language.

            - its reliability, security, and platform independence.

            - Java code can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

            - Java is the primary language for developing Android apps.
              
            - Java can be used to build web applications and servers using frameworks like Spring and JavaServer Faces.
