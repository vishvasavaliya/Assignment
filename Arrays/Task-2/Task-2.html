 <!-- Explain the methods push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() used in arrays. -->


 push() method:

 The push() method in JavaScript is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array. 
 It modifies the original array and returns the new length of the array.

 array.push(element1, element2, ..., elementN)

 pop() method:

 The pop() method in JavaScript is used to remove the last element from an array and return that element. 
 It modifies the original array by reducing its length by one.

 array.pop();

 shift() method:

 The shift() method in JavaScript is used to remove the first element from an array and return that element. 
 This method changes the original array by reducing its length by one.

 array.shift()

 unshift() method:

 The unshift method in JavaScript adds one or more elements to the starting of an array and 
 returns the new length of the array.

 array.unshift(element1, element2, ..., elementN)
