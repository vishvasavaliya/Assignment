<!-- What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? Explain with examples.
• Arithmetic operators
• Assignment operators
• Comparison operators
• Logical operators -->


Ans:-
      
1. Arithmetic operators:- 
                          These operators perform basic arithmetic operations.

                 examples:- 
                            	Addition   (+)      let sum = 5 + 5;
                                Subtraction (-)     let difference = 10 - 5;
                                Multiplication (*)  let product = 2 * 5;
                                Division (/)        let quotient = 15 / 3;


 2. Assignment Operators:- 
                          These operators assign values to variables. 

                 example:- 
                           Assignment  (=+)                   let x = 10;
                           Addition assignment (+=)           x += 5; // x = x + 5 
                           Subtraction assignment (-=)        x -= 3; // x = x - 3
	                       Multiplication assignment (*=)	  x *= 2; // x = x * 2
                           Division assignment (%=)	          x /= 4; // x = x / 4
                           Modulus assignment  (%=)           x %= 2; // x = x % 2
                           Exponentiation assignment (**=)    x %= 2; // x = x % 2

3. Comparison Operators:-
                         These operators compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).

                example:- 
                	      Equal to  (==)          	    5 == 5 // true
                	      Not equal to	(!=)            5 != 3 // true
                          Strict equal to  ( ===) 	    5 === "5" // false
                	      Strict not equal to  (!==)	5 !== "5" // true
                	      Greater than	   (>)          10 > 5 // true
                	      Less than	 (<)                3 < 7 // true
                	      Greater than or equal to	(>=)   10 >= 10 // true
                          Less than or equal to	    (<=)   5 <= 7 // true
                           

 4. Logical Operators:- 
                         These operators combine multiple conditions to form more complex expressions.

                example:- 
                      Logical AND (&&)      &&(5 > 3) && (2 < 4) // true
                      Logical NOT (!)       !(5 > 3) // false
