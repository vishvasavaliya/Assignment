<!-- What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let,and
const?
 -->

 1. var Keyword:-
                  Declares a variable that can be reassigned and re-declared within its scope.

                  The scope of a var variable can be either global or function-scoped.

    Example:-   

     var x = 10;
     x = 20; 
    
    function myFunction() {
        var y = 5;
        console.log(y); // Output: 5
    }
    
    console.log(x); // Output: 20 
          
      

2. let Keyword:-
               Declares a variable that can be reassigned but not re-declared within its scope.
               
               The scope of a let variable is block-scoped, meaning it's only accessible within the block where it's declared.

    Example:- 

    let x = 10;
    x = 20; 
    
    {
        let y = 5;
        console.log(y); // Output: 5
    }
    
    console.log(x); // Output: 20
              

3. const Keyword:-
                   Declares a variable that cannot be reassigned or re-declared.
                   
                   The scope of a const variable is also block-scoped.

 Example:- 

 const PI = 3.14159;
  {
     const x = 10;
     console.log(x); // Output: 10

 }
