<!--  Explain the different data types in JavaScript. Provide examples for each. -->

-  JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
-  you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. 
-  The 1  interpreter automatically infers the data type based on the value assigned to the variable. Â  

primary data types in JavaScrip:- 

(1) Primitive Data Types:- 

(Numbers: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.)
                             
    Example:- 
          let age = 25;
          let pi = 3.14159

(String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.)
    
    Example:- 
          let name = "abc";
          let greeting = 'Hello, world!';
                                                           
(Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.)

    Example:- 
        let isStudent = true;
        let isRaining = false;

(Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.)

     Example:- 
         let x; // x is undefined

(Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.)

   Example:- 
         let y = null;

(Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as identifiers.)

     Example:- 
        let symbol1 = Symbol("mySymbol");
