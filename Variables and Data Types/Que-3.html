<!-- What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript? -->

- While both undefined and null in JavaScript represent the absence of a value, they have distinct meanings.

- UNDEFINED:-
             A variable is declared but not assigned a value.

             JavaScript automatically assigns undefined to such variables.

             undefined is a primitive data type.

example:-
         let x; // x is declared but not assigned, so its value is undefined
         console.log(x); // Output: undefined


- NULL:-
        A variable is assigned the value null.

        It's used to indicate the deliberate absence of a value.

        null is also a primitive data type.

Example:
        let y = null; // y is assigned the value null
        console.log(y); // Output: null
