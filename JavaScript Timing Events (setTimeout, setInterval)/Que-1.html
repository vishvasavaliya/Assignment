Explain the setTimeout() and setInterval() functions in JavaScript. Howare they used for timing events?

The window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.These time intervals are called timing events.

The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:

setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

setInterval(function, milliseconds)
Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.
