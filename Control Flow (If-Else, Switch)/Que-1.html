 <!-- What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work with an example. -->

 Control flow is the order in which statements are executed in a program. 
 The default control flow is for statements to be read and executed in order from left-to-right,
 top-to-bottom in a program file.

How if-else statements work:

An if-else statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. 

if: Checks whether a given condition is true.
else: Executes a block of code when the condition is false.

Example:

let number = -5;

if (number > 0) {
  console.log("The number is positive.");
} else {
  console.log("The number is negative.");
}
