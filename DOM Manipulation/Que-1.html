 <!-- What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript? How does JavaScript interact with the DOM? -->

 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
 It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects;  programming languages can interact with the page

JavaScript Interacts with the DOM:

document.getElementById('id'): Selects an element by its id attribute.

document.getElementsByClassName('class'): Selects elements by their class attribute.

document.querySelector(): Selects the first matching element based on a CSS selector.

document.querySelectorAll(): Selects all matching elements.
