A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. It helps in organizing code, making it modular, and promoting code reusability.




function calculateArea(width, height) {
    const area = width * height;
    return area;
  }

  const rectangleArea = calculateArea(5, 10);

  console.log("The area of the rectangle is:", rectangleArea);
