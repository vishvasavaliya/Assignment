<!-- What is the difference between a function declaration and a function
expression? -->




Function Declarations:
                       When you need a function to be accessible before it's defined.
                       For reusable functions that are used throughout a program.
                      syntax:-  function functionName(parameters) { ... }
                       Can be used before declaration


Function Expressions:
                      When you want to create anonymous functions.
                      When you need to pass a function as an argument to another function.
                      To create IIFEs for private scoping.
                      syntax:-const functionName = function(parameters) { ... };
                      Must be defined before use
